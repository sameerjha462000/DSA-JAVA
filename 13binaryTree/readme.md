Binary trees 
1. In a binary tree, each node can have at most 2 children
2. leaf nodes --  nodes having no child 
3. root node -- node from which the tree starts
4. size -- no of nodes in the BT
5. height -- there are two ways to define this. One is defined as the number of the nodes in the longest path from root node to a leaf node(including both of them)
6. The other way could be -- the number of edges in the longest path from a root node to a leaf node
7. Generally second one is called height.
